### Homework Assignment 1 Assessment

We assessed your submissions and unfortunately most do not conform to Duckietown's safety requirements. As the next homework and more or less everything we will do with Duckiebots depends on good calibration many of you will have to repeat this step. Duckie safety comes first!

* If you are Zijian, your localization is good, so you don't have to do anything.

* If you got `okeyish` then, it will probably be fine but you might want to repeat it.

* If you got `repeat`, well, that's pretty self-explanatory. Repeat until good and submit again (just update your old file).

* If you got `not submitted`, that probably means you did not submit the first homework yet. If that's not the case, let Aleks know. If it is the case, please submit as soon as possible! Everything should be working now, so no excuses!

If you wonder what makes for good or bad one-shot localization and how to make sure your new attempt is compliant, see [here](http://docs.duckietown.org/DT18/opmanual_duckiebot/out/camera_calib.html). Essentially, you should look at the bottom left image. It shows how the detected segments (top right) project on the map. If they are not fitting well with the lanes, are not parallel, or are distorted, then the one-shot localization is not good. The detected segments should also be correct (being part of the lane lines and colored correctly).

Note that bad one-shot localization can be a result of putting your Duckiebot on an unsuitable stretch of road, having other things around, bad lighting, or pure bad luck. It can also be caused by bad camera calibration, so it might be necessary to repeat that as well!
