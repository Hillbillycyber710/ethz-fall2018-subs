I initially had some trouble with frames in which the camera seemed 'stuck'. This occured especially with the sine experiment, and more in the initial part (when the duckiebot moved slower and was further from the calibration pattern). I believe this could be partly due to the lightning conditions: when moving the entire setup in an environment with more-diffused and uniform light (e.g. sunlight coming from the window) I obtained slight improvements. However, I noticed that the calibration procedure is somehow unstable and very sensitive to the terrain conditions as well as to the wheels and to the omnidirectional sphere in the rear. I tried minimizing these conditions by periodically removing the dirt under the wheels, running experiments on a flat surface (parquet), tightening the wheels to their axes (still some oscillations around the axis are present when the motors are on). I also ran some intermediate calibrations by backing up the calibration files but, although after the third calibration the results had got very promising at a certain point, things somehow got worse again when trying to perform further experiments, with a high sensitivity to the specific trial.
The results I got were overall still quite satisfactory for the ramp experiment, but I believe that if we were able to make the calibration more robust to small environmental changes the quality of my calibration might largely improve.
