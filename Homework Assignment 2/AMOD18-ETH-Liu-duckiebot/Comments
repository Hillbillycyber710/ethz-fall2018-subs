experiment:
I used the same ramp input and changed the amplitude of the sine input with setting the k2 parameter as 0.06, 0.08, 0.1
observation: 
As the amplitude increases, the optimization result get worse. The prediction curves after optimization become more different with the measured curves.
And the divergence between predicted curves and measured curves will accumulate as the time goes, which is especially obvious in the picture of Ramp Manouver.
And I got the best estimation curves after optimization when I set k2 as 0.06
