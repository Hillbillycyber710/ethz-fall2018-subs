In experiment_1 I used the default parameter which generated
a driving pattern that was well followed by the bot.

In experiment_2 I used the half the value of the default parameter
which generated a pattern that was better followed by the bot. I assume
smaller magnitude makes it easier for the bot to follow and not lose then
checker board due to motion blurr.

In experiment_3 I used double the default parameter which generated
a pattern that was less well followed by the bot and the camera
also struggled with capturing the checkerboard.

Although the duckiebot (kleinesentlein) followed the pattern
good each time, when using the teleoperation command no
significant improvement was observed in the end. I would argue that
the manual calibration delivered superior calibration result
then the system identification. Which can be explained with terrain roughness,
wheel slippage and motion blurr...

[I have repeated the system identification 5 times and was not able to get 
better results with my hardware]
