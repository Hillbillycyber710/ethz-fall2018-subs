Experiment one (sine at 0.06) ran correclty but the analysis afterward gives preposterous results (trim > 2 ...)

Experiment two (sine at 0.10) ran somewhat better and the analysis gives normal results, but the output trim, 0.14, is actually way too much for the robot, which has a manual trim close to 0.02.

Experiment three (sine at 0.12) ran porly, the robot loosing track of the target due to the sin amplitude giving blury images. The trim result is useless as well. I tried to do it again but time after time the calibration doesn't keep a good track ofthe checkerboard.

Experiment four (sine at 0.15) weirdly ran better than the others, for some random reason. It kept a good track of the checkerboard. However, the sine analysis is again not working well, giving a trim value too big again (trim = 0.10)
