The first observation that could be made is that the optimized parameters have a smaller difference than the default parameters when their predicted position is compared to the measured position. From this, it could be inferred that the parameters to model the kinematics/dynamics of the Duckiebot do get better after optimization as the predicted values gets closer to the ones by the actual model.

The second observation that could be made was that the prediction got worse when the amplitude of the sine wave increased. From this it could be inferred that model used for the Dukiebot do not have sufficient parameters to capture the complexity of larger change in the motion of the Duckiebot. Therefore the error in the predicted values as compared to the actual values gets larger for increase amplitude in sine wave input.

The third observation was that the trim values vary greatly for all three different amplitudes of sine wave input. From this, it could be inferred that the trim value might work well for small changes in the motion of the Duckiebot about a reference state, but it will start to differ more as the motion change gets larger. Therefore the trim value cannot be a constant value for every state that the Duckiebot is in, which was the assumption made for the modelling of the kinematics/dynamics of the Duckiebot.

In the end, the trim and gain values of the Duckiebot was adjusted manually using observation. The trim and gain values obtained from the optimized parameters of the Duckiebot model were used as starting values for the manual adjustments. The trim value with the least deviation when the Duckiebot moved in a straight line was chosen and the gain value was kept as there were no slippage observed when the Duckiebot moved.
