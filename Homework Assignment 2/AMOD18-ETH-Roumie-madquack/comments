As can be seen in the plots included in the respective calibration folders, the third experiment shows that the prediction with the optimal values is very close to the measurement, in both the sine and ramp input cases. However, the sine wave shows a delay, and some data points are lost in the procedure. Same thing applies to the ramp input. This may be the cause of the discrepancy between values of gain and trim parameters for the manual calibration and those calculated with the SysID optimization procedure. The first experiment (ramp input case) shows that the predicted values of y and yaw are closer to the measured ones than those predicted with the default ones. The same applies to the second experiment, but for x instead of y. Little can be inferred from the sine input cases for both the first and second experiment. The second experiment actually yields an optimal value of trim (in absolute value) that is much closer to that found from manual calibration than any of the other experiments.
