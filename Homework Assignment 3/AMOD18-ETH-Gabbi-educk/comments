Sampling : 1 (default)
Delay : 2.0
Omega : 100 (default)

No significant changes are observed. I observe less oscillations but more overshoots.

Sampling : 4
Delay : 0.0 (default)
Omega : 20 

No significant changes are observed. 

Sampling : 5
Delay : 0.0 (default)
Omega : 100 

No significant changes are observed. My omegas values showed in the terminal have a maximum of 3 so having a max at 100 has no effect.

Sampling : 4
Delay : 1.0 (default)
Omega : 1

The duckiebot is out of control!


Sampling : 1
Delay : 0.0 (default)
Omega : 2

The duckiebot is not able to complete the turn. The limit on the omega prevents it from doing narrow turns
