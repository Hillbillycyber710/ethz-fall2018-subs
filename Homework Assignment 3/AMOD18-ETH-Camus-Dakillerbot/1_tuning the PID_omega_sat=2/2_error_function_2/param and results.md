### Error fonction : err = delta (6 r + 1.5 phi)
### In all this, omega_sat was 2.0

video 2.3:

kp = 4
ki = 0.1
kd = 0

--> no big difference, still some error, some oscillation



video 2.4:

kp = 4
ki = 0.1
kd = 0.05

--> less error and oscillation



video 2.5:

kp = 4
ki = 0.1
kd = 0.1

--> way too much damping, it doesnt turn enough



video 4.2: 

kp = 4
ki = 0.05
kd = 0.01

--> pretty good, stable (made a lot of turns succesfully)
